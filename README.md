# skeleton_notes-app

A Notes App built with [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/), a UI Toolkit for **Svelte + Tailwind**.

Kudos to [Huntabyte](https://github.com/huntabyte/noted-skeletonui) for the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_A0qQ7AuK8&list=PLeIh1fX3_xOPcbs1BrhWpQQllHzwBpn75).

This project was scaffoled using the *Skeleton CLI*:

```bash
npm create skeleton-app@latest my-skeleton-app
	# - Enable SvelteKit's Typescript syntax (recommended)
cd my-skeleton-app
```


# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
